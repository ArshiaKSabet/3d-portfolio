          <h2>üßë‚ÄçüíªThis website was made with Three.js</h2>
          <p>
            Inbefore my technical interview, I felt that learning the fundamentals of 3D (WebGL) would've been a good asset. 
          </p>
  
          <p>
            After proceeding with a tutorial, I started experimenting by myself. The Doughnut for example, was a 3D model I loaded in by myself while the cubes were made from scratch with Three.js
          </p>
  
          <p>
            While reaching the finishline with this website, I noticed that this would make a great portfolio. Upon publishing the website, I'll add my bigger projects to show them here.
          </p>
          <h2>üñ•Ô∏è Projects</h2>
  
          <p>
            The biggest projects I've made until today would be the Spotify Clone. Other than that I've also integrated a Klarna Checkout which was very valuable to learn.
          </p>
  
          <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>
  
          <p>
            I graduated through TechOver Academy which was an intense bootcamp, and now I am studying C#/.NET fulltime to expand my knowledge.
